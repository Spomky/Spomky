### Hi there üëã

My name is **Florent Morselli** (*fl…î Å…ëÃÉ m…î Åseli*). I am a French web developer and project manager passionated by PHP, ReactJS and Free, Libre & Open-Source Softwares
As far as possible, I contribute to projects or publish my own work.

The projects I am working on are mainly related to security over web applications. In particular, you will find useful libraries of Symfony bundles for One-Time Passwords (TOTP/HOTP), Json Web Tokens (JWT, including signed and encrypted ones), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and Webauthn.

Among all of these project, let me encourage you to read more about [Webauthn](https://github.com/web-auth), a PHP implementation I am working on since end of 2018 and that will help you to get rid of passwords. I presented the possibilities offered by this technology during the second edition of ApiPlatformCon in September 2022 in Lille, France.
