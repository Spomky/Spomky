### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Florent Morselli. I am a French web developer passionate about PHP, ReactJS, and Free, Libre & Open-Source Software
As far as possible, I contribute to projects or publish my own work.

Among all of these projects, let me encourage you to read more about [Webauthn](https://github.com/web-auth), a PHP implementation I am working on that will help you to get rid of passwords.

I am currently learning how to build fast and reliable static websites usingGatsbyJS / NextJS. Also, I read a lot of papers and online courses regarding Finite State Machines principles.

Feel free to ask me about all of these FLOSS projects or reach me on any other topics you may want to discuss.

Hereafter an overview of my involvement in the Open-Source ecosystem.
If you wish, you can sponsor me. The [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/Spomky/) or the [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/FlorentMorselli) are made for that purpose. Any help is greatly appreciated and allows me to spend time on these projects.
