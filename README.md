### Hi there üëã

My name is **Florent Morselli** (*fl…î Å…ëÃÉ m…î Åseli*). I am a French web developer and project manager passionate about PHP, ReactJS and Free, Libre & Open-Source Software.
As far as possible, I contribute to projects or publish my own work.

The projects I am working on are mainly related to security over web applications. In particular, you will find useful libraries of Symfony bundles for
* One-Time Passwords (TOTP/HOTP) => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/otphp,
* Json Web Tokens (JWT, including signed and encrypted ones) => see https://github.com/web-token,
* Web Push => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/web-push,
* Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/cbor-php,
* Webauthn => see https://github.com/web-auth.

Among all of these projects, let me encourage you to read more about [**Webauthn**](https://github.com/web-auth), a PHP implementation I am working on since end of 2018 and that will help you to get rid of passwords. I presented the possibilities offered by this technology during the second edition of ApiPlatformCon in September 2022 in Lille, France.

In addition, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge on web application security on workshops I gave during [Symfony Live Paris 2023](https://live.symfony.com/2023-paris/workshop/maximiser-la-securite-de-vos-applications-avec-le-bundle-security).
In December 2024, I will provide new training on [security with Symfony](https://live.symfony.com/2023-brussels-con/workshop/road-to-safer-applications).

Feel free to ask me about all of these FLOSS projects or reach me on any other topics you may want to discuss.

Hereafter an overview of my involvement in the Open-Source ecosystem.
If you wish, you can sponsor me. The [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/Spomky/) or the [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/FlorentMorselli) are made for that purpose. Any help is greatly appreciated and allows me to spend time on these projects.
