### Hi there üëã

My name is **Florent Morselli** (*fl…î Å…ëÃÉ m…î Åseli*). I am a French web developer and project manager passionate about PHP, ReactJS and Free, Libre & Open-Source Software.
As far as possible, I contribute to projects or publish my own work.

> üß° Since early 2025, I am proud to be a ![Symfony Core Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/Symfony-Core%20Team-orange?style=flat-square&logo=symfony).
> This allows me to help shape the future of the framework I use and love daily.

The projects I am working on are mainly related to security over web applications. In particular, you will find useful libraries of Symfony bundles for
* One-Time Passwords (TOTP/HOTP) => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/otphp,
* Json Web Tokens (JWT, including signed and encrypted ones) => see https://github.com/web-token,
* Web Push => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/web-push,
* Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/cbor-php,
* Webauthn => see https://github.com/web-auth.

Among all of these projects, let me encourage you to read more about [**Webauthn**](https://github.com/web-auth), a PHP implementation I am working on since end of 2018 and that will help you to get rid of passwords.

In addition, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge during the following events:

* September 2022: I presented the possibilities offered by this technology during [the second edition of ApiPlatformCon](https://youtu.be/Y2_0omg1CFk) in September 2022 in Lille, France.
* March 2023, I gave two 1-day workshops during the [Symfony Live Paris 2023](https://live.symfony.com/2023-paris/workshop/maximiser-la-securite-de-vos-applications-avec-le-bundle-security).
* December 2023, I gave a 1-day workshop during the [Symfony Con Brussels 2023](https://live.symfony.com/2023-brussels-con/workshop/road-to-safer-applications).
* March 2024, I presented my feedback on [the Progressive Web Apps](https://live.symfony.com/2024-paris/schedule/de-web-app-a-progressive-web-app) and [gave a 1-day workshop](https://live.symfony.com/2024-paris/workshop#securite-amelioree-et-webauthn-avec-symfony-2) during the Symfony Live 2024.
* March 2025, [I gave a 1-day workshop](https://live.symfony.com/2025-paris/) during the Symfony Live 2025
