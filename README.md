### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Florent Morselli. I am a French web developer passionated by PHP, ReactJS and Free, Libre & Open-Source Softwares
As far as possible, I contribute to projects or publish my own work.

Among all of these project, let me encourage you to read more about [Webauthn](https://github.com/web-auth), a PHP implementation I am working on and that will help you to get rid of passords.

I am currently learning how to build fast and reliable static websites usingGatsbyJS / NextJS. Also I read lot of papers and online courses regarding Finite State Machines principles.

Feel free to ask me about all of these FLOSS projects or reach me on any other topics you may want to discuss.

Hereafter an overview on my involvement in the Open-Source ecosystem.
If you wish, you can sponsor me. The [Gihub Sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/Spomky/) or the [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/FlorentMorselli) are made on that purpose. Any help is greatly appreciated and allow me spending time on these projects.
