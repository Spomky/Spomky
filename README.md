### Hi there üëã

My name is **Florent Morselli** (*fl…î Å…ëÃÉ m…î Åseli*). I am a French web developer and project manager passionate about PHP, ReactJS and Free, Libre & Open-Source Software.
As far as possible, I contribute to projects or publish my own work.

The projects I am working on are mainly related to security over web applications. In particular, you will find useful libraries of Symfony bundles for
* One-Time Passwords (TOTP/HOTP) => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/otphp,
* Json Web Tokens (JWT, including signed and encrypted ones) => see https://github.com/web-token,
* Web Push => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/web-push,
* Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) => see https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/cbor-php,
* Webauthn => see https://github.com/web-auth.

Among all of these projects, let me encourage you to read more about [**Webauthn**](https://github.com/web-auth), a PHP implementation I am working on since end of 2018 and that will help you to get rid of passwords.

In addition, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge during the following events:

* September 2022: I presented the possibilities offered by this technology during [the second edition of ApiPlatformCon](https://youtu.be/Y2_0omg1CFk) in September 2022 in Lille, France.
* March 2023, I gave two 1-day workshops during the [Symfony Live Paris 2023](https://live.symfony.com/2023-paris/workshop/maximiser-la-securite-de-vos-applications-avec-le-bundle-security).
* December 2023, I gave a 1-day workshop during the [Symfony Con Brussels 2023](https://live.symfony.com/2023-brussels-con/workshop/road-to-safer-applications).
* March 2024, I presented my feedback on [the Progressive Web Apps](https://live.symfony.com/2024-paris/schedule/de-web-app-a-progressive-web-app) and [gave a 1-day workshop](https://live.symfony.com/2024-paris/workshop#securite-amelioree-et-webauthn-avec-symfony-2) during the Symfony Live 2024.

Feel free to ask me about all of these FLOSS projects or reach me on any other topics you may want to discuss.

Hereafter an overview of my involvement in the Open-Source ecosystem.
